# PWM specifications

There are 8 PWM channels available on CFA10036 board.

Here's the pinout table for corresponding PWM channel.

| PWM channel no | Ball no of CFA10036 | Pin no in CFA10037 |
|:--:  |:--:| :--:  |
| PWM0 | K7 | P3.16 |
| PWM1 | L7 | P3.17 |
| PWM2 | K8 | P3.18 |
| PWM3 | G7 | P3.20 |
| PWM4 | G6 | P3.21 |
| PWM5 | F7 | P3.22 |
| PWM6 | E7 | P3.23 |
| PWM7 | E8 | P3.26 |




```Note: There is an issue with PWM2 to PWM6.```

```They won't work with Userspace code directly. Work around for that problem is available.```
