# Userspace-Arduino for CFA10036

Almost every hobbyist related to embedded field is familier with Arduino. Arduino is a simple yet powerful set of hardware and software solution for hobbyist programmer to industries developers. Nice documentation and ease of programming made it so popular among folks in embedded community!

Complexity of driving external pheripherals in linux environment hinders many users in their projects. This may result in more development time and money. Quick development and ease of usage make Arduino this famous. Though when it comes to processing speed, there is no match between Arduino boards and crystalfontz's CFA10036 linux System on Machine (SOM). This project aims to deliver same experience as Arduino with much more processing power to the crystalfontz's customers. Same lines of code that instruct Arduino board to perform something, can be used by crystalfontz's CFA10036 too.
