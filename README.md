# Userspace-Arduino for CFA10036

Almost every hobbyist in the embedded field is familiar with Arduino. Arduino is a simple yet powerful integration of hardware and software for hobbyist programmers and developers. Good documentation and ease of programming has made it very popular in the embedded community.

**Userspace-Arduino** aims to bring the advantages of working on the Arduino platform to linux. Combining the speed and reliablity of linux machines with the ease of writing code for the Arduino may help new developers who want a bit more processing power than an ATmega328.

Almost all Arduino libraries can be made for linux, barring a few exceptions. Available sketches can be ported to Userspace-Arduino with minor or no modifications. The following pages document these differences.
