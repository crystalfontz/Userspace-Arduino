### Userspace Arduino for [CFA10036](https://www.crystalfontz.com/product/CFA10036)

#### Introduction

Almost every hobbyist in the embedded field is familiar with Arduino. Arduino is a simple yet powerful integration of hardware and software for hobbyist programmers and developers. Good documentation and ease of programming has made it very popular in the embedded community.

Userspace-Arduino aims to bring the advantages of working on the Arduino platform to linux. Combining the speed and reliablity of linux machines with the ease of writing code for the Arduino may help developers who want a bit more processing power than an ATmega328.

Almost all Arduino libraries can be port to linux, barring a few exceptions. Available sketches can be ported to Userspace-Arduino with minor or no modifications. For more details refer Documentation.

### Getting Started

Please go throught [getting started](http://crystalfontz.github.io/Userspace-Arduino/getting_started/README.html) and [issues and limitation](http://crystalfontz.github.io/Userspace-Arduino/known_issues/README.html) before writing a sketch for CFA10036.

### Examples

https://github.com/crystalfontz/Userspace-Arduino/tree/master/arduino-makefile/examples

### TODO

1. Multithreading execution of sketch
2. Handling GPIO interrupts in userspace
3. Arduino like IDE
